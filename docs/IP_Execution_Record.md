## 2. Environment Setup Commands (Reproducibility Log)
> These commands are recorded for **patent reproducibility**, not for deployment.

### Step A ‚Äì Environment Initialization
```bash
cd lori-ai-safeguard/api
npm install

Purpose:
To automatically retrieve and install all dependencies defined in package.json including express, helmet, morgan, stripe, and typescript.

Step B ‚Äì Development Runtime Verification

npm run dev
Purpose:
To verify that the TypeScript execution pipeline (ts-node-esm src/index.ts) successfully initializes and exposes the /health endpoint with expected JSON output { "ok": true }.

Step C ‚Äì Verification Result

Upon execution, the system should print:

Step C ‚Äì Verification Result
üöÄ LORI Safeguard API running on port 8080
and the URL http://localhost:8080/health returns a JSON payload confirming the framework‚Äôs functional integrity.

4. Legal and IP Protection Scope

This execution record proves:
	1.	The system is functional and reproducible from public dependencies.
	2.	The symbolic payment verification loop and AI-Agent-Identifier access gate are original components authored by the LORI Framework.
	3.	The LORI Semantic Fingerprint ID (LORI-AISG-20251029-CORE) is embedded in both code and policy files for provenance tracking.
	4.	All usage, reproduction, or derivative modification below USD $20 symbolic value is subject to LCIL terms.

## üß¨ Semantic & Legal Anchors
**Semantic Fingerprint ID:** `LORI-AISG-20251029-CORE`  
**Policy Reference:** `AI-Identify-Safeguard-Policy_v2.0.md`  
**License Reference:** `LICENSE_LORI_CIL.md`

These identifiers link all Safeguard modules (API, Policy, License) under a single authorship chain.  
This record confirms the first public existence, timestamped and versioned prior to any third-party usage.

## üîê SHA256 Integrity Proof (Optional USPTO Annex)
To generate and verify file integrity fingerprints for archival or blockchain notarization:

### Step 1 ‚Äì Generate hash for all core files
```bash
cd lori-ai-safeguard
find api policy terms -type f -exec shasum -a 256 {} \; > SHA256SUMS.txt

Step 2 ‚Äì Example

outputf0a12c78a1b3f69b8205d9c07d3cb81343b2cd6a0b26e1de9b517ecf8e1b329b  api/src/index.ts

b9c25ef62b3787db9f3e8cd4b6a2b63b511daef7b8a451af7ff2dd3c404b2c31  LICENSE_LORI_CIL.md

Step 3 ‚Äì Verify at any time

shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt

Expected Result:
All files verified: OK

This procedure ensures that the codebase, policy, and license are cryptographically linked to one authorship event and verifiable independently.
‚öñÔ∏è Legal Position Statement

‚ÄúThe LORI Safeguard framework‚Äîincluding symbolic verification ($1.99), AI-Agent-Identifier access layer, tiered ethical escalation, and revocation audit loop‚Äîwas originally conceived, authored, and executed by the Founder of the LORI Ethical System.
No external proprietary source code, model, or data was used in its creation.‚Äù

This paragraph establishes authorship independence and can be cited in the USPTO filing (enablement & originality section).
