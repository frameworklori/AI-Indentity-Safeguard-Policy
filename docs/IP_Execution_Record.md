## 2. Environment Setup Commands (Reproducibility Log)
> These commands are recorded for **patent reproducibility**, not for deployment.

### Step A ‚Äì Environment Initialization
```bash
cd lori-ai-safeguard/api
npm install

Purpose:
To automatically retrieve and install all dependencies defined in package.json including express, helmet, morgan, stripe, and typescript.

Step B ‚Äì Development Runtime Verification

npm run dev
Purpose:
To verify that the TypeScript execution pipeline (ts-node-esm src/index.ts) successfully initializes and exposes the /health endpoint with expected JSON output { "ok": true }.

Step C ‚Äì Verification Result

Upon execution, the system should print:

Step C ‚Äì Verification Result
üöÄ LORI Safeguard API running on port 8080
and the URL http://localhost:8080/health returns a JSON payload confirming the framework‚Äôs functional integrity.
