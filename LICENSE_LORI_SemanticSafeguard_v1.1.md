Access to restricted LORI Framework modules requires identity verification and a symbolic validation payment of USD $1 (or higher at LORI discretion). The $1 payment is processed through a secure payment gateway with 3D Secure and AVS checks. Additional verification (government ID upload and liveness selfie) may be required depending on requested access level. LORI reserves the right to suspend or revoke access in case of suspected fraud, chargeback, or policy violations. All verification data will be stored for audit and compliance, subject to our Privacy Policy.

----
凡欲存取 LORI Framework 受限模組，皆須完成身分驗證並繳交象徵性驗證費 USD $1（LORI 有權視情況調整金額）。該款項將透過安全支付閘道（含 3D Secure 與 AVS）處理。依存取等級，可能需額外上傳政府核發身分證件並提供 liveness 自拍比對。若疑有詐欺、退款（chargeback）或違規情形，LORI 有權暫停或撤銷存取權。驗證資料將保存作為稽核與合規用途，並受隱私政策保護。
