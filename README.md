## Overview
This repository is an **open resource** dedicated to establishing safeguards against the misuse of AI in **identity manipulation** (face-swapping, deepfake voice, or other personal-identity transformations).

The guiding principle is:
- **Free Tier (Open Use)** â†’ Only safe, low-risk AI functions (e.g., artistic effects, style transfer, creative augmentation).
- **Paid + Verified Accounts (KYC + Credit Card)** â†’ Access to high-risk functions, ensuring accountability through payment traceability.

This repo serves as a **baseline policy** for AI developers, policymakers, and research communities.

---

## Goals
1. **Fraud Prevention** â€“ Reduce misuse of AI in scams and impersonations.
2. **Identity Protection** â€“ Ensure individuals are not cloned or manipulated without consent.
3. **Accountability** â€“ Tie high-risk use cases to verifiable, traceable accounts.
4. **Transparency** â€“ Provide an open, community-driven framework.

## Key Safeguards
- ðŸ”’ **Access Control**: High-risk functions available only for verified paying users.
- ðŸ§¾ **Audit Logging**: All usage tied to account ID, payment reference, and content hash.
- ðŸŒŠ **Watermarking**: Mandatory embedded digital watermarks for AI-generated face/voice content.
- ðŸ“œ **Legal & Policy Alignment**: Enforce terms of service forbidding fraud, harassment, or impersonation.
