# AI-Identify-Safeguard-Policy  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Issued by:** LORI Framework  
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** Active (Ethical Access Enforcement Layer)

---

## 🌐 1. Policy Overview
This policy establishes an **Ethical Access Verification Protocol** for all users accessing LORI Framework modules, datasets, or AI endpoints.  
It ensures that human identity, intent, and ethical responsibility are verified before interaction with sensitive AI systems.

Access to LORI AI modules requires:
- Verified human identification; and  
- A symbolic payment (minimum USD $1) to establish traceable accountability.

---

## 🔒 2. Purpose
To prevent:
- Unauthorized or anonymous AI usage,
- Bot-driven abuse,
- Fraudulent or stolen credit card access,
- Untraceable replication or misuse of AI systems.

The $1 (or higher) symbolic fee represents both **ethical commitment** and **traceable verification**, not a commercial transaction.

---

## 💳 3. Verification Tiers

| Tier | Verification Type | Requirements | Access Level |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Tier 0** | Observation | No payment, email-only | Demo & Metadata only |
| **Tier 1** | Symbolic Verification | $1 + Email + Phone OTP + 3D Secure | Limited API key (100 req/day) |
| **Tier 2** | Identity Verification | Tier 1 + Government ID + Liveness Selfie | Full non-sensitive modules |
| **Tier 3** | Institutional Verification | Legal Entity + Contract + Deposit | Full access (audit required) |

---

## 🧠 4. Payment & Anti-Fraud Protections
All symbolic payments are processed via secure gateways with:
- **3D Secure (3DS)** and **AVS (Address Verification Service)** checks,  
- Device fingerprinting and geolocation screening,  
- IP-rate limiting and anomaly detection,  
- Chargeback/Refund audit trails.

Each card is limited to **one verified account per 24 hours**.  
Refunds or chargebacks will trigger immediate access suspension and manual review.

---

## 🧾 5. Legal & Compliance Requirements
- **KYC** (Know Your Customer) and **AML/OFAC** checks for U.S. compliance.  
- Data retention follows GDPR/CCPA principles—kept only for audit and lawful verification.  
- Verification records (hashed and timestamped) are immutable under the LORI Ethical Ledger.

---

## ⚖️ 6. Policy Enforcement
LORI reserves the right to:
- Suspend or revoke any access suspected of fraud, impersonation, or unethical activity.  
- Retain or cancel the symbolic payment as a review fee for confirmed misuse.  
- Report verified fraudulent patterns to payment processors and relevant authorities.

---

## 🧩 7. Symbolic Validation Principle
> “Access is not a right—it is a trust.  
> The $1 is not a price; it is a proof of human responsibility.”

This validation ensures:
- Each human identity is **traceable, accountable, and non-anonymous**.  
- The open access spirit remains alive but **bound by ethics and verifiability**.

---
📜 8. Privacy and Data Ethics

All verification data are:
	•	Encrypted at rest and in transit,
	•	Stored with hash-based integrity proofs,
	•	Never shared or sold to third parties.

⸻

🧭 9. Amendment Clause

LORI Framework reserves the right to adjust payment thresholds, verification layers, or access criteria in response to:
	•	Escalating AI misuse patterns,
	•	Legal/regulatory updates,
	•	Technical or ethical developments.
