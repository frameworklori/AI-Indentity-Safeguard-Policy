🧭 FIG.2 – Tier Verification Flow

📄 語義敘述（Description）

FIG.2 presents the tiered verification process used by the LORI Safeguard Framework to differentiate between levels of identity assurance and access privileges.
The system operates through a progressive three-tier model:
	1.	(201) Tier 0 – Symbolic Verification Stage
The user or AI agent performs a micro-payment of USD 1.99 and basic identity input. Upon successful validation, a Limited Token is issued allowing minimal-risk API access (typically 100 calls/day).
	2.	(202) Tier 1 – KYC & Behavioral Verification Stage
The entity submits government-issued identification and liveness verification (e.g., face match or document token). Upon approval, access expands to Full Token status, removing daily limits but maintaining behavioral monitoring.
	3.	(203) Tier 2 – Corporate Integrity Verification Stage
For AI companies or institutional agents, a refundable Corporate Deposit of USD 1,000 is required. The entity must register a verifiable AI-Agent-Identifier Header and agree to the Corporate Integrity License (CIL).
	4.	(204) Escalation Path
Any suspicious behavior detected by the risk engine (205) triggers a downgrade, manual review, or account freeze as described in FIG.3.

The flow ensures that every user or AI progresses through measurable integrity checkpoints, guaranteeing that higher privileges correspond to stronger verification and accountability.

-----
Why numbering sequence (203→202→201→204→205) is intentional
The numbering reflects verification hierarchy rather than chronological order.
(203)–(201) represent descending trust levels (corporate → behavioral → symbolic).
(204) indicates the fallback tier (lowest symbolic level), while (205) is an external escalation node defined in FIG.3.
This structure intentionally visualizes downgrade flow rather than upgrade path, aligning with the LORI Safeguard philosophy of “trust-by-proof, not privilege-by-default.”

FIG. 2 – Tiered Verification Process (LORI Safeguard)
Verification operates through four tiers: corporate, KYC + behavioral, symbolic, and Tier 0.
The risk engine (205) monitors for abnormal behavior. Any flag triggers an automatic downgrade path (↘) toward Tier 0, where access is limited and manual review is required as described in FIG. 3.
This hierarchical design ensures progressive trust validation while maintaining a reversible safety mechanism.
