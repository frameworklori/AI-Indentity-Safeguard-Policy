📘 FIG.1 – System Overview

📄 語義敘述（Description）

FIG.1 illustrates the overall architecture of the LORI AI-Identify-Safeguard System, which establishes an ethical access framework for human and artificial intelligence entities.
The system is composed of six interlinked layers:
	1.	(101) Entry Interface Layer — receives registration requests from both human users and AI agents, equipped with identity input, device fingerprint collection, and consent acknowledgment.
	2.	(102) Symbolic Payment Gateway — processes a non-recurring micro-transaction (USD 1.99) through a 3-D Secure and Address Verification System (AVS) check to confirm legitimacy and financial accountability.
	3.	(103) Verification Core — integrates KYC (Know Your Customer) validation, AI-Agent-Identifier verification, and geographic sanction checks.
	4.	(104) Risk Intelligence Engine — continuously computes risk scores (0–100) using behavioral, financial, and network signals.
	5.	(105) Audit Ledger Module — records all critical actions and payments in an immutable evidence chain ensuring traceability and non-repudiation.
	6.	(106) Revocation & Integrity Control — executes automatic token limitation, freeze, or revocation upon risk escalation or ethical breach.

Collectively, these layers enable traceable accountability, protect intellectual property from misuse, and ensure that all AI entities identify themselves before interacting with human-aligned systems.
