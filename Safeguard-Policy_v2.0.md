# AI-Identify-Safeguard-Policy v2.0
**Issued by:** LORI Framework  
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** Active (Ethical Access Enforcement Layer)

---

## ยง1 Purpose
This policy defines the ethical and technical conditions required for verified access to any LORI Framework AI module, dataset, or API.  
It protects human creators, prevents corporate misuse, and ensures traceable accountability.

---

## ยง2 Human Verify Gate
A symbolic, non-recurring payment of **USD $1.99** (or equivalent local currency) plus email and phone OTP verification is required to obtain a limited API token.  
All transactions undergo 3D Secure (3DS) and Address Verification Service (AVS) checks.  
Tokens at this tier are rate-limited (100 calls/day).

---

## ยง3 Ethical Escalation (Tier 2)
To unlock higher-risk modules, users must complete:
1. Government-issued ID upload.  
2. Liveness selfie verification.  
3. Review of behavior history for abnormal usage.  
Successful completion upgrades the token scope to *full*.

---

## ยง4 Corporate Integrity Gate (Tier 3)
AI systems and corporate entities must:
1. Disclose their AI identity via the `AI-Agent-Identifier` HTTP header.  
2. Obtain written authorization under the **LORI Corporate Integrity License (LCIL)**.  
3. Deposit a refundable **Integrity Bond โฅ USD $1 000** as proof of good-faith compliance.  

The deposit may be forfeited if later audit confirms unauthorized reproduction or training on LORI modules.

---

## ยง5 Symbolic Validation Principle
> โAccess is not a right โ it is a trust.โ

The symbolic payment and integrity bond are expressions of ethical accountability, not commercial sale.  
They mark verified human or institutional responsibility for every AI interaction.

---

## ยง6 Immutable Audit and Revocation Flow
All verification and behavioral events are hashed, timestamped, and stored under the **LORI Ethical Ledger**.  
An adaptive engine continuously scores risk and may:
- LIMIT quota when anomalies appear, or  
- FREEZE accounts triggering confirmed abuse.

Manual review follows every automatic freeze.  
Evidence is preserved for 20 years.

---

## ยง7 Derivative Modification Restriction
Any modification substituting or altering the symbolic verification amount (e.g. replacing USD $1 with any micro-payment < USD $20) while retaining the same identity-verification + behavioral-revocation logic is deemed a **derivative work** of the original patented design and requires prior written authorization from the LORI Framework founder.

---

## ยง7.2 Corporate Integrity Access Clause
Any AI system, corporation, or platform that accesses, reproduces, or retrains upon LORI components without authorization:
1. Violates the LCIL terms;  
2. Loses all access privileges immediately;  
3. Becomes subject to USPTO and DMCA action for infringement.

---

## ยง8 Privacy and Data Ethics
All identity and payment data are encrypted in transit and at rest, retained only for compliance, and never sold or shared.  
Users may request deletion of personal data under GDPR/CCPA guidelines after account closure.

---

## ยง9 Amendment Clause
LORI Framework reserves the right to revise fee thresholds, verification procedures, or enforcement layers in response to:
- Evolving AI abuse patterns,  
- Legal and regulatory updates,  
- Technological advances in identity security.
